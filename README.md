Synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) provide ultra-fast light pulses at tuneable wavelengths. Their primary drawback is the need for precise cavity control (temperature and length), with flexibility issues such as fixed repetition rates and marginally tuneable pulse widths. Targeting a simpler and versatile OPO, we explore the inherent disorder of the refractive index in single-mode fibres realising the first random OPO -- the parametric analogous of random lasers. This novel approach uses modulation instability ($\chi^{(3)}$ non-linearity) for parametric amplification and Rayleigh scattering for feedback. The pulsed system exhibits high inter-pulse coherence (coherence time of $\sim$0.4~ms), offering adjustable repetition rates (16.6--2000~kHz) and pulse widths (0.69--47.9~ns). Moreover, it operates continuously without temperature control loops, resulting in a robust and flexible device, which would find direct application in LiDAR technology. This work sets the stage for future random OPOs using different parametric amplification mechanisms.
